A search engine for developers to find Github Repos, youtube tutorials, online courses, and documentation faster. Try it out [here](https://devxplore.herokuapp.com/).

## Why DevXplore?

As a developer myself, I had problems finding the right tutorials, learning resources for me. Then one day I thought what if a search engine classifies its search into several categories for developers.

So I created DevXplore.
