# DevXplore 

[![PR's Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://makeapullrequest.com)   


A search engine for developers to find Github Repos, youtube tutorials, online courses, and documentation faster.

## Why DevXplore?

As a developer myself, I had problems finding the right tutorials, learning resources for me. Then one day I thought what if a search engine classifies its search into several categories for developers.

So I created DevXplore.
